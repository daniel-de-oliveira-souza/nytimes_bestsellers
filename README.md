# The New York Times - Best Sellers

## Context

The New York Times Best Sellers list is one of the most important lists in the book publishing industry. On the one hand, knowing which books in a publisherâ€™s catalog are being nominated on the list is essential for the publisher to prioritize marketing resources. On the other hand, this list is a crucial source of understanding the social trending interests so that a publisher can identify if they have any books with similar subjects/topics with the hope of promoting these books will receive good attention.

## Add-Ons

An admin can manually trigger the dag so additional recipients can receive the latest list by passing their email addresses through airflow dag configuration json.

{"additional_emails":["additional_recipient1@gmail.com",
                      "additional_recipient2@gmail.com",
                      "additional_recipient3@gmail.com"]}


## Future Developments

Send the results to some email recipients as attachments so we can take advantage of other file formats, such as .csv and image files.
